In this project I implement realistic Real Estate web site.

Tools:
Python
Streamlit
AWS / Azure / Google Cloud / (something else)

Tasks:

Understand Huge Dataset
Build Reliable model
Build Web Interface
Upload model to cloud
Connect web interface with cloud model

This project will take a while, but...

It's just cool.

I'll start with simple CaliforniaHousePricing Dataset.
And slowly will move on Zillow Dataset with 3 Million Samples!
